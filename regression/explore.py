# Exercises
# Our scenario continues:
# As a customer analyst, I want to know who has spent the most money with us 
# over their lifetime. I have monthly charges and tenure, so I think I will be 
# able to use those two attributes as features to estimate total_charges. I 
# need to do this within an average of $5.00 per customer.

# Create a file, explore.py, that contains the following functions for 
# exploring your variables (features & target).

# Write a function, plot_variable_pairs(dataframe) that plots all of the 
# pairwise relationships along with the regression line for each pair.

# Write a function, months_to_years(tenure_months, df) that returns your 
# dataframe with a new feature tenure_years, in complete years as a customer.

# Write a function, plot_categorical_and_continous_vars(categorical_var, 
# continuous_var, df), that outputs 3 different plots for plotting a 
# categorical variable with a continuous variable, e.g. tenure_years with 
# total_charges. For ideas on effective ways to visualize categorical with 
# continuous: https://datavizcatalogue.com/. You can then look into seaborn 
# and matplotlib documentation for ways to create plots
